# I created an interactive HTML/SVG canvas named "Vitruvian-construction-and-polygon-convergence" in the workspace.

Open that document to view the step-by-step geometric construction, the polygon → circle convergence (n = 4, 8, 16, 64), and a Vitruvian-style stick figure overlaid using classical proportions. The file includes:

Numeric mapping (example model height → visual scale) so you can set a real height (e.g. 1800 mm) and see the geometry scale correctly.

Polygons drawn programmatically (inscribed, rotated to start at top) so you can visually follow how the finite tends to the infinite circle.

A Vitruvian-style overlay: square posture (arms horizontal) and circle posture (arms/legs touching the circle), with navel as circle center and annotations.

A small export tool (Ctrl+E) to save a PNG snapshot of the diagram.
