# I created a new interactive document named "Vitruvian-Annotated-Proportions-and-Vector-Figure" that contains:

• An annotated numeric table of Leonardo/Vitruvian proportions (computed in mm for any model height you provide).
• A refined vector Vitruvian figure (SVG) that maps those exact marginal ratios: the square centered on the genitals, the circle centered on the navel, head = H/8, arm-span = H, foot = H/6, hand = H/10, elbow→hand = H/4, shoulder width = H/4, etc.
• UI you can use to enter any height (e.g., 1800 mm) and redraw the table + vector.

Sources used for the ratios and placement (for transparency): Leonardo’s Vitruvian corrections and Vitruvius’s canonical measures. Representative references: Wikipedia’s Vitruvian Man article (Leonardo’s correction: square center at genitals, circle center at navel).
